# CrappyCardStuffInJava
A school project with cards, blackjack and war. I just wanted to add it to github
We were learing about Object programming in Java, Inheritance, Polymorphism and other stuff.
One of the tasks was to make classes to be able to play card games like Blackjack and War.
I may or may not want to expand this project in the future that is why I am adding it to github.
